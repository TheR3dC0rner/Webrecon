webrecon requires 2.7.  This instructions relate to BT 5.  

This is my attempt to automate some of my recon work of nmap, thumbnailing and direcory busting.


To install type:
apt-get install dirb
apt-get install gnome-web-photo

To use:

 ./webrecon -h this will give this basic help
  -h, --help        show this help message and exit
  -t SCAN_TYPE      Type of scan to perform: internal,external,quick,file
  -n NETWORK_RANGE  Network range to scan or file name in network scan
  -p REPORT_DIR     Project name to be stored in report dir


-h is for the basic help options

Scan Types:
internal:  scan the subnet for 80,443..presume all the hosts found with open and closed ports are actual hosts on the network. Contine with the full service scan on these hosts.
external:  presume there is a firewall and when the scanner exapands to the full port scan then scan every host on the subnet
quick:  just check port 80 and 443

Network Range:
this should take standard nmap ranges.  This include using a -iL if you have a file list to use
Also use -n for the file path if using a file type scan

-p this is report directory where all the data is being stored.  This will eventually have a report.html file but i have not done this yet

There is also a config file it comes with these settings:

nmap_base = "nmap -PN -n -T5 -vvvvv --max-retries 1 "
report_dir = "reports/"
initial_nmap = "-p 80,443"
full_nmap  = "-p1-65535"	
wordlist = "/pentest/enumeration/web/dirb/wordlists/common.txt"
dirb_base= " "
thumb_check = "yes"
dirb_check = "yes"
max_ports ="5"
max_hosts = "5"
dirb_location = "/pentest/enumeration/web/dirb/dirb"


Nmap Base:
This setting is what will be used for every nmap scan.  My default is aggressive because i was in test mode

Initial Nmap:
THis setting is what the first scan does.  This gets added to the nmap_base You can define it anyway you want.  I currently only look at 80-443

Full Nmap:
This also is what it will be added to the nmap_base.  This is the second stage of the scan.  You can modify and what you want.

Word list:
The location of the dictionary to be used

dirb_base:

You can add addition options to dirb


Thumb Check and Dirb Check:

You can optionally turn of thumbnailing and directory busting

Max Ports:
How many ports per host to attept to at once

Max Hosts:
Total number of hosts to try at once

dirb location:

Location of the dirb binary
